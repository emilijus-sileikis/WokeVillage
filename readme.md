# "Minecraft" Plugin from "Paskui Solutions"

Server modification for "Minecraft", which adds extra NPC's to the world.

## Description:

Our main goal is creation of a functional NPC (Non Playable Character) plugin in “Minecraft: Java Edition”, using our developed “PaperMc” server API. These NPC's sometimes spawn in vanilla Minecraft villages and can provide great amounts of resources for a certain price. This feature saves the players time and prevents the need of grinding, while the game itself becomes a more relaxed experience and still remains challenging.

NPC's have roles: 
- Miners;
- Woodcutters;
- Fishers;
- Hunters;
- Farmers.

Roles determine what type of resource the NPC will be willing to gather, which further decreases the chance of the player to accidentally stumble upon the needed NPC. This encourages traveling and adventuring instead of grinding resources.
Further more they have personality traits, some of them generous, some of them lazy, which will impact the loot you get from their gatherings and the time it takes for them to complete the task.

## System/Software Requirements:

1. Java 16 (or OpenJRE 16, or OpenJDK 16).

> Usually **Minecraft: Java Edition** min requirement is Java 1.8,
> but after 1.17 version **Mojang** switched over to Java 16.

2. **PaperMC** jar file.

> To create and run server and support this pluign.

These requirements also apply for developers too.

## Instalation:

- Download the .ZIP file from "Paskui Solutions";
- Extract the ".jar" file;
- Copy the ".jar" file into the servers "/plugins" directory.
