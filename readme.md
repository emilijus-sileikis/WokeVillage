**"Minecraft" Plugin from "Paskui Solutions"**

Server modification for "Minecraft", which adds extra NPC's to the world.

Description:
- 
Our main goal is creation of a functional NPC (Non Playable Character) plugin in “Minecraft”, using our developed “PaperMc” server API. In the finished product, our NPC will be able to complete certain tasks/get hired for gold or food. Possible work fields: mining, tree chopping, harvesting food, etc.

Requirements:
-
This plugin runs on the Java edition of Minecraft, either on your local game or a dedicated server.

It can’t be used on Realms, Windows 10 Edition, Bedrock Edition, or Pocket Edition versions. These versions of Minecraft have limited or no mod support. Note that “Windows 10 Edition” refers to a specific Edition of Minecraft, not the Java Edition running on a Windows 10 computer.

Instalation:
- 
- Download the .ZIP file from "Paskui Solutions";
- Extract the ".jar" file;
- Copy the ".jar" file into the servers "/plugin" directory.

Guide:
- 
The interface would be available in command or inventory-like interface when you right click them. Commands would allow admins to manually spawn the NPC (later might be more than one type) and configure some settings. An inventory-like interface would allow players to select available NPC settings (and administrators could have extra options).
Since these NPC’s will be useful we plan to make them hard-to-find in order to keep the thrill and interest of the vanilla game itself. They might spawn in different biomes or in certain villages.
