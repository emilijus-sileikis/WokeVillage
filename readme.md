**"Minecraft" Plugin from "Paskui Solutions"**

Server modification for "Minecraft", which adds extra NPC's to the world.

Description:
- 
Our main goal is creation of a functional NPC (Non Playable Character) plugin in “Minecraft”, using our developed “PaperMc” server API. In the finished product, our NPC will be able to complete certain tasks/get hired for gold or food. Possible work fields: mining, tree chopping, harvesting food, etc.

Requirements:
-
REQ-MustHave-Edition1: Use only Java Edition of Minecraft.<br>
  <em> Explanation: It can’t be used on Realms, Windows 10 Edition, Bedrock Edition, or Pocket Edition versions. These versions of Minecraft have limited or no mod support. Note that “Windows 10 Edition” refers to a specific Edition of Minecraft, not the Java Edition running on a Windows 10 computer. </em>

REQ-MustHave-Server2: Use servers mentioned below. <br>
 <em>REQ-MustHave2.1: Local game;<br>
 REQ-MustHave2.2: Dedicated server.</em>

REQ-HighlyRecommended-Version1: Use the latest version of Java Edition Minecraft, upwards from Minecraft: Java Edition 1.17.1.<br>
  <em>Explanation: The plugin has been developed on Minecraft: Java Edition 1.17.1 and will be supporting newer upcoming versions. Use in earlier instalations of the game could result in crashes/bugs and is not recommended.</em>

Instalation:
- 
- Download the .ZIP file from "Paskui Solutions";
- Extract the ".jar" file;
- Copy the ".jar" file into the servers "/plugin" directory.

Guide:
- 
The interface would be available in command or inventory-like interface when you right click them. Commands would allow admins to manually spawn the NPC (later might be more than one type) and configure some settings. An inventory-like interface would allow players to select available NPC settings (and administrators could have extra options).
Since these NPC’s will be useful we plan to make them hard-to-find in order to keep the thrill and interest of the vanilla game itself. They might spawn in different biomes or in certain villages.
